## Old Ideas, Discarded for Cilia

For several topics there are alternative ideas, that were discarded but are still worth mentioning.


### Keep Trailing Semicolons
- As this is difficult & unclear/disputed: Keep C++ semicolons for now?
- Disadvantages of not having trailing semicolons:
    - Errors are less easily recognized. (Walter Bright / D: „Redundancy helps“)
    - Probably a completely new parser must be written, as the one from clang (for C++) no longer fits at all.
- Implicitly/clever multiline expressions as in Swift, Kotlin and JavaScript?  
  (Actually I don't know / remember the rules anymore.)


### Better Readable Keywords
- Instead of `class ... : ...` Cilia could have
    - `class ... extends ...` 
        - good for extending base classes
    - `class ... implements ...`
        - good fit for implementing pure abstract base classes (like interfaces)
- But then we would have two different keywords. And what about mixed cases, i.e. abstract classes with partly function implementation? (Probably best to use `implements` then, but still not nice.)


### Basic / Arithmetic Types
- `Float` could be 32-bit float: `Float` == `Float32`,
    - like in C++.
    - Then `Float` == `Float32` on all platforms.


### Variable Declaration
- Very short variable declaration:
    - Maybe possible to simply write `i = 3`?
    - Maybe `i := 3`?
- `let i = 0` instead of `const i = 0`
    - similar to Swift and Carbon.
    - In Rust `let mut` is used for variables,
    - in JavaScript `let` and `const` are very similar with slight differences.
- Always starting with keyword `var`
    - Examples:
        - `var Int i`
        - `var i : Int`
    - In case `func` for function declaration, but not `var` for variable declaration, is still not clear enough.
    - Swift, Kotlin and Circle always start variable declarations with `var`.
    - Not starting with `var` could be especially problematic in connection with omitting the trailing semicolons.


### Bitfields
One could define the order of bit in a bitfield.
- MSB (Most Significant Bit) first.
    - This way you can use
      ```
      class Float32Equivalent {
          UInt32:1  signIsNegative
          UInt32:8  exponent
          UInt32:23 significand // AKA mantissa
      }
      ```
      to read/interpret `Float32`,
    - and with
      ```
      class SignBitOfInt64 {
          UInt64:1 signIsNegative
      }
      ```
      signIsNegative is true for negative Int64.
    - Bits are left-aligned, so the first element always covers the most-significant bit:
      ```
      class MostSignificantThreeBits {
          UInt8:1 bit7
          UInt8:1 bit6
          UInt8:1 bit5
          // ...
      }
      ```
    - This is what typical "MSB-first" C++ compilers do (on big-endian PowerPC, MIPS, SPARC).
        - CiliaC may have to reverse the order of bit field elements and add some padding `UInt32:... __filler_for_right_alignment` (when using typical "LSB-first" C++ compilers like GCC x86).
    - Add your own filler (padding bits) to shift field elements/members on demand, e.g.
      ```
      class Sign {
          UInt32:1  filler
          UInt32:31 bit0
      }
      ```


### Functions
- Function declarations could start with the keyword
    - `fn` (Rust, Carbon, New Circle),
    - `fun` (Kotlin), or
    - `function` (Julia)
- **Extension methods**
    - Possible, alternative syntax:  
      `func toString (Int this) -> String`
- **Function pointers**
    - Possible, alternative syntax variants:
    - Variant B:
        - `func((Int, Int) -> Int)* pointerToFunctionOfIntAndIntToInt`  // Closer to the function declaration but (too) many brackets
    - Variant C:
        - `(Int, Int -> Int)` [Functions are only available as pointers, so you can omit "*"?]
    - Variant D:
        - `func*(Int->Int) pointerToFunctionOfIntAndIntToInt`
        - `func*(Int) pointerToFunctionOfInt`
    - Variant E:
        - `func*(Int, Int)->Int pointerToFunctionOfIntAndIntToInt`
        - `(func*(Int, Int)->Int)[] arrayOfPointersToFunctionOfIntAndIntToInt`


### Function/Loop Parameter Passing
- If you want even the basic type to be different, we could write:
    - `for Double d in [1, 2, 3] { ... }`
        - `d` is `const Double`
    - `for String str in ["a", "b", "c"] { ... }`
        - `str` is `const String` (not `const StringView&`)
        - ~~`str` is `const String&` (not `const StringView&`)~~
            - TODO This dosnn't actually make sense here, you can not get a (const) reference to a string, when the underlying array is in fact a `StringView[]`.
    - `for inout String str in ["a", "b", "c"] { ... }`
        - `str` is `String&`
        - TODO This dosnn't actually make sense here, you can not get a (mutable/non-const) reference to a string, when the underlying array is in fact a `StringView[]`.
    - `for copy String str in ["a", "b", "c"] { ... }`
        - `str` is `String`


### Switch/Case
- Old behavior with implicit `fallthrough` on demand.
  ```
  switch i fallthrough {
  case 1:
  case 2:
  case 3:
  case 4:
  case 5:
      print("1, 2, 3, 4, or 5")
      break
  
  default:
      print("default")
  }
  ```


### Literals
- `true`, `false` are Bool
- `Null` could be the null pointer, and `NullType` its type.
    - Shorter and more similar to `NULL` in C.

          
### Signed Size
- `UInt` as type for `*.size()` (i.e. still unsigned)  
  but with new rules for mixed integer arithmetic:
    - Unsigned +-*/ Signed -> Signed.
        - Signed is therefore considered the "larger" type compared to unsigned
        - `1` is `Int` (signed)
            - `1u` is `UInt` (unsigned)
        - Therefore `if aUInt - 1 >= 0` is a useful expression (as `1` is signed, `aUInt - 1` is signed, too)
        - But then also `aUInt + 1 == anInt`
- Or
    - `Size` - `Size` -> `SSize`
        - Problem: `-` results in `SSize`, but `+` results in `Size`?!
    - The conversion of a negative number into `Size` leads to an error instead of delivering a HUGE size.
- Note: In the end this just didn't work out.


### Operators
- Possible, alternative syntax for `pow(a, x)`:  
  `a**x` (as Python did)
- Some more kinds of range literals could be useful:
    - `8>..0:-1` – 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0
        - RangeExclusiveStartByStep(8, 0, -1)
    - `8>..0:-3` – 7, 4, 1
        - RangeExclusiveStartByStep(8, 0, -3)
    - `8..>0:-1` – 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
        - RangeExclusiveEndByStep(8, 0, -1)
    - `8..>0:-1` – 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
        - RangeDownwardsExclusiveEndByStep(8, 0, -1)
    - Incomplete ranges
        - `0<..` – RangeFromExclusiveStart(0)
    - Incomplete range with step
        - `8>..:-1` – RangeFromExclusiveStartByStep(8, -1)
        - `8>..:-2` – RangeFromExclusiveStartByStep(8, -2)
    - `0<..2` – RangeExclusiveStart(0, 2)
    - Range with negative step used for downwards iterating ranges: 
        - `2..0:-1` – RangeWithStep(2, 0, -1)
        - `3>..0:-1` – RangeExclusiveStartWithStep(3, 0, -1)
        - Incomplete ranges with negative step: 
            - `..1:-1` – RangeToWithStep(1, -1)
            - `2..:-1` – RangeFromWithStep(2, -1)
            - `3>..:-1` – RangeFromExclusiveStartWithStep(3, -1)
            - `..:-1` – RangeFullWithStep(-1)
    - Note: Too complicated for too little benefit.
- Maybe remove `++i`, `--i`, `i++`, `i--`?
    - as Python
    - only offer/allow `i += 1`, `i -= 1`  
      or even only `i = i + 1`, `i = i - 1`
    - Note: No, Cilia is a C++ descendant after all.


### Templates
- **Class** templates  
    - Partial template specialization could be written
      ```
      class<type T, Int N> MyUniquePtr<T[N]> {
          ... destructor calls delete[] ...
      }
      ```
- **Function** templates
    - _Explicit_ function templates could be written as:
      `func<Number T> add(T x, y) -> T { return x + y }`
    - Extension function templates could be written as  
        - `template<type T, Int N> func T[N]::size() -> Int { return N }`
        - `template<type T, Int N> func T[N]::convertTo<type TOut>() -> TOut[N] { ... }`
- Template **type alias** could be written as:
    - `template<type T> using T::InArgumentType = const T&`


### Cilia Standard Library
- "**Alias**" for 
    - member variables could be written as  
       `alias x = data[0]`,
    - member functions could use perfect forwarding,
        - see [stackoverflow.com/a/9864472](https://stackoverflow.com/a/9864472)
        - but that would not work for virtual functions.


### String, Char & Unicode
- **Code points** could be represented by `UInt32` or by an distinct type `CodePoint` (== `UInt32`).
    - Would it be useful?
- `WideChar` could be useful for portable code (Linux `UInt32` <-> Windows `UInt16`)
    - But you may use `wchar_t` then.
- Alternative names/syntax to iterate over strings:
    - `for codeUnit in "abc 🥸👮🏻".asCodeUnits()` (a bit more explicit/clear than `.asArray()`)
    - Is `byWord()` (like in "word by word") a better naming?
        - `for graphemeCluster in text.byGraphemeCluster()`
        - `for codePoint in text.byCodePoint()`
        - `for codeUnit in text.byCodeUnit()`
        - `for codeUnit in text.byChar()`
        - `for word in text.byWord()`
        - `for line in text.byLine()`
        - `for sentence in text.bySentence()`
     

### Arrays & ArrayViews
- `Int[] dynamicArrayOfIntegers`
    - May be confusing because it is so similar to fixed-size arrays,  
      but IMHO the inconsistency is **already in C/C++**:  
        - in function declarations
            - `int[]` and `int*` are actually the same,
        - but for local variables
            - `int[]` and `int*` mean different things:
                - `int array[3]` and `int array[] = { 1, 2, 3 }` are used for in-place arrays,
                - `int* array = new int[3]` is used for an int-array of _unknown size_.
- Mixed forms of static and dynamic array may be useful:
    - `Int[3,,]`
    - `Int[3,4,]`


### (Smart) Pointers
- We may user some more (or just other) characters for the "special" pointers
    - ASCII
        - `Type> pointer` (_very_ difficult to read with template types, e.g. `Matrix<Float64>> matrix`)
        - `Type~ pointer` (also used for binary not and destructor syntax)
        - `Type# pointer`
        - `Type% pointer`
        - `Type§ pointer`
        - `Type$ pointer`
        - `Type' pointer`
        - `Type. pointer`
    - More exotic characters
        - (But a character that is difficult to find on the keyboard would not actaully encourage people to use this syntax.)
        - Latin-1
            - `Type° pointer`
            - `Type¹ pointer`
            - `Type• pointer`
            - `Type› pointer`
        - Unicode variants of `T*`
            - `Type*̂ pointer`
            - `Type*̄ pointer`
            - `Type*̇ pointer`
            - (easy to confuse with `T*`)
    - `*` plus other character(s)
        - (a bit long)
        - `Type*^ pointer`
        - `Type*+ pointer`
        - `Type*. pointer`
        - `Type*° pointer`
        - `Type*¹ pointer`
        - `Type*+ pointer`
        - `Type*> pointer`
        - `Type*1> pointer`
        - `Type*¹> pointer`
        - I don't like this:
            - `Type^* pointer`
            - `Type+* pointer`
            - `Type.* pointer`
- `new T` returns a `T+`/`UniquePtr<T>`,
    - so `T+`/`UniquePtr<T>` is the "default type" for pointers,  
      e.g. `ContactInfo+ contactInfoUniquePtr = new ContactInfo`.
    - `T[0]+`/`UniquePtr<T[0]>` is the "default type" for pointers to array,  
      e.g. `ContactInfo[0]+ contactInfoUniqueArrayPtr = new ContactInfo[10]`.
- A classical C/C++ "raw" pointer is still possible, but inconvenient to use.
    - `ContactInfo* contactInfoPtr = (new ContactInfo).release()`  
      `delete contactInfoPtr` (with classical/raw pointers you need to free the objects yourself)
    - `ContactInfo* contactInfoPtr = (new ContactInfo[10]).release()`  
      `delete[] contactInfoPtr` (you need to distinguish single-element- and array-pointers yourself)


### `is`, `as`, Casting
- Automatic casts
    - As multiple inheritance is problematic here:
        - In Cilia/C++, an object can be an instance of several base classes at once, whereby the pointer (sometimes) changes during casting.
        - What if you still want/need to access the functions for a `Type obj` after `if obj is ParentA`?
        - Therefore maybe better: `if obj is String str ...`
            - as in C#


### Versioning
Versioning of the Cilia source code could alternatively be done
- via file ".cilia_version" in a (project) directory,
- via file extension: 
    - "*.cilia2024" – Version from the year 2024
    - "*.cilia2024b" – Second version from the year 2024
    - "*.cilia_2024" – Version from the year 2024
    - "*.cilia_2024b" – Second version from the year 2024
    - "*.ciliaA"
    - "*.ciliaB"
